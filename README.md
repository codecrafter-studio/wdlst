## The History of This Project
This project used to be public on member rgzz666's blog and his website, open-source under MPL-2.0. It was rarely known on the Internet.

This project is recently moved to CodeCrafter Studio's GitHub and will be maintained by all members (including the original author rgzz666), due to the lack of ideas for new project.

The project is still owned by the original author rgzz666, and rgzz666 reserves the right to reclaim project copyrights.
